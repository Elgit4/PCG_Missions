# CMI backend implementation status

**Baseline:** CMI Follow-up v2.1  
**Workspace:** `supabase-cmi/` (isolated from historical `supabase/`)  
**Status:** Identity, contacts/follow-up and restricted-pastoral schemas have passed isolated local CMI validation. The events/attendance/transport/public-content slice is now added as a review draft and wired into the disposable local CI workflow; its run is pending.

## Implemented and validated

- Dedicated Supabase CLI project with a distinct local project ID and non-conflicting ports.
- Church/branch foundation, Auth-linked staff profiles, six-role catalogue, capability catalogue, role assignments, teams and service areas.
- RLS enabled and browser grants withheld on foundation tables; no role-capability grants seeded.
- Contacts/follow-up draft: contacts, capture provenance/idempotency, staff/team assignment, notes, interactions, merge history, follow-up lists/tasks and append-only task events.
- Restricted pastoral draft: prayer requests/assignments, care groups/records/assignments/interactions, and separate append-only prayer/care access-audit ledgers.
- CI validation of the first three suites on an isolated local Supabase stack: identity/authorization (14 assertions), contacts/follow-up (24), restricted pastoral (20). Recorded in [run 42436473154](https://github.com/Elgit4/PCG_Missions/actions/runs/42436473154).

## Newly added — events, attendance, transport and public content

Source files:
- `schema-drafts/events_attendance_public_content.sql`
- `schema-drafts/events_attendance_public_content.test.sql`

The draft adds 19 relations covering:
- Events and separate typed staff/team event assignments.
- Event registrations with branch-consistent contact links and request idempotency.
- Transport options and seat reservations.
- Event check-in with mandatory event-scoped idempotency and registration duplicate protection.
- Event closeout and append-only closeout history.
- Calendar entries with typed branch/team/event/own scope rather than polymorphic IDs.
- Announcements with typed team/event audience links.
- Church public profile, welcome messages, sermons, daily words, digital tracts and typed external document links.

The draft intentionally excludes waitlists, public browser table access, role-specific policies, direct registration writes, announcement SMS delivery state, and public content projections. RLS is enabled and browser grants are withheld on all 19 new tables. Capacity enforcement remains a trusted serialized transaction requirement, not a client-side count. Public registration, attendee snapshot retention and walk-in identity rules remain subject to D-05, D-06 and D-13.

The CI workflow now generates a temporary migration filename using `supabase migration new`, applies this draft on the disposable local CMI stack, runs its 36-assertion pgTAP suite, and removes temporary files afterward. This new suite has not yet passed; do not describe it as validated until its GitHub Actions run succeeds.

## Deliberately not implemented

- Full six-role capability grants and role/scope RLS policies; R-01–R-12 and D-01 remain approval gates.
- Staff credential activation/reset implementation; Supabase Auth remains the credential authority.
- Trusted transactional contact merge/reversal.
- Audited prayer/care read Edge Function/RPC.
- Trusted registration, capacity reservation, transport-seat allocation and check-in endpoints.
- Public content projection endpoints.
- SMS provider adapter, consent/suppression, callback verification, dispatch budget and automation.
- Reporting, audit retention policy and limited-offline device enrollment.
- Production deployment or hosted database linking.

## Verification boundary

The existing 58 assertions validate the identity, contacts/follow-up and restricted-pastoral draft structure and deny-by-default posture. The new event/public-content draft is queued for CI validation and has not yet been run. No hosted Supabase project was linked, queried, migrated or modified; no real visitor/prayer data or live SMS was used.

Supabase CLI v3 is local-first. Keep CI on the isolated `supabase-cmi/` workspace and do not add `--remote` or hosted credentials without explicit deployment approval.
